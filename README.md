### Study notes
|Date| Note |

|09/20/2019|Started reading [The Go Programming Language](https://github.com/evowilliamson/golang-learning/blob/master/resources/The%20go%20programming%20language%20(personal%20copy).pdf). Finished chapter 1|
|10/18/2019|Reading paragraph 2.3.4 about lifetime of variables [The Go Programming Language](https://github.com/evowilliamson/golang-learning/blob/master/resources/The%20go%20programming%20language%20(personal%20copy).pdf). Garbage collection is mentioned in this paragraph and started reading [Getting to Go: The Journey of Go's Garbage Collector](https://blog.golang.org/ismmkeynote)|
|10/18/2019| Hudson ([Getting to Go: The Journey of Go's Garbage Collector](https://blog.golang.org/ismmkeynote)) mentions [The tail at scale](https://github.com/evowilliamson/golang-learning/blob/master/resources/The%20tail%20at%20scale%20-%20Dean.pdf). This seems to be an interesting article regarding scaling web applications that also mentions Lamport's Paxos implementation. Reading it first, then go back to [Getting to Go: The Journey of Go's Garbage Collector](https://blog.golang.org/ismmkeynote)
